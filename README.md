# Programming language classification

## Setup
To setup environment: 
1. make sure you have [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) installed
2. Run ```make create_env```

## Description
This project's goal was to develop a programming language classifier within 8 hours.

Due to that, the code is suboptimal at times. Nonetheless, 82% accuracy was achieved and reasonable code readibility.

To experiment with the model see [WorkingClassifier.ipynb](WorkingClassifier.ipynb)
